# Unsupervised Machine Learning Models

Unsupervised ML models for Game Balancing, Game Design, Character Combat Analysis

## What's in this repository

1. Decision Tree & Random Forest models with Employee Attrition Data
2. Game Deisgn Project: Pokemon CHallenge, Predicting face-off 'winners' based on character attributes

## Game Design Project

1. Logistic Regression
- fitting the model 
- evaluating the model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- confusion matrix

2. Random Forest 
- search for best parameters
- gridsearch with 100 estimators then through max depth
- fit the model
- check the accuracy
- validating the RF model

3. KNN
- fit
- accuracy
- model evaluation

# Bias - Varuance Tradeoff
- approximation/estimation trade off, heart of all of Machine Learning. 
- Answers the question, how do we choose a good model? 
- Bias/approximation has to do with how well your model does on average
- variance/estimation has to do with how your model responds to variation in the input data
