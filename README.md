Machine Learning Models

1. Logistic Regression
- fitting the model 
- evaluating the model: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1
- confusion matrix

2. Random Forest 
- search for best parameters
- gridsearch with 100 estimators then through max depth
- fit the model
- check the accuracy
- validating the RF model

3. KNN
- fit
- accuracy
- model evaluation
